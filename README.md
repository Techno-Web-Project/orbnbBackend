# orbnbBackend

This repository contain the backend of our project, programming in Spring.

## How to run the project

To run the project you need to clone it and to open it in an IDE (we recommand you to use IntelliJ).
You need to create a database called 'orbnb' in your MySQL database. If you don't usually use MySQL you can have it easily by installing XAMPP on your computer. To run the project you need to start the Apache and MySql modules on XAMPP.

Then you can run the OrbnbBackEndApplication classes.
